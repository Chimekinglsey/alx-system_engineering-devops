    Nigeria is yet to attain the ranks of a developed economy due to lack of structural change, among other factors. Also, it was observed that a factor crucial to this lack of economic progress is the lack of economic diversity which has caused the economy to rely heavily on crude oil for revenues and as the major export commodity in the economy (Osuntogun et al, 1997). Prior to the 1970s, Nigeria’s exports were predominantly non-oil commodities with agricultural commodities accounting for the lion share. However, in the 1970s, when the price of crude oil in the international market sky rocketed, the share of non-oil exports began falling and have remained low ever since. This is majorly due to the money-spinning nature of oil exports which makes it more profitable to export oil and less profitable to export non-oil commodities. This has cause a rather heavy
dependence on the oil sector and the proceeds from the exportation of crude oil. This heavy reliance subjects the country to difficulties when the price of crude oil, the major export commodity, is low in the international market. In light of this, the government adopted various strategies to boost non-oil exports and stabilize the
economy. In spite of these efforts, the performance and contribution of the non-oil exports sector has remained very low. The sector has continued to perform below its full potential. This research is therefore carried out to determine to what extent the diversification of the economy will help enhance the economic progress of the
economy, to appraise the past efforts at diversification and to discover how the current performance of the non-oil sectors can be improved.</p></div>
