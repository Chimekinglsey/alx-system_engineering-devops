		<div class="overflow">Makefile updates our executable files automatically once we run 'make'
The 'make' searches for a named file called 'makefile or Makefile or GNUmakefile'
So, basically uhm..it is basically a utility or a software that manages and maintain a computer porogram.
What it does is that, it splits a computer program into small small chunks and checks for any possible errors. Once 

the makefile contains sets of instructions known as rules
the make command loooks for makefiles and executes those rules written inside
again, when an uhm..when and why and how to use the makefile </div>
	<div class="overflow">WHEN
	Used for compiling and building
	- A situtation where it is used for the building process of a software. I.e when we want to run our c files, we normally call
	the gcc with some flags like -Wall etc. with the makefile, we can declare those flags as a variable to avoid unneccesary repetition
	 using the make command.</div>
	
	<div class="overflow">
	<p class="shift">MANAGING DEPENDENCIES BTW FILES
	- makefile allows us to declare dependencies in a single file which are needed for our program to run
	- executing complex tasks - it way more beyond recompilation pursposes
		- it can be used for deploying software and automation 
		- documentation
		- testing 
		- all of them can be automated with makefiles </p></div>
